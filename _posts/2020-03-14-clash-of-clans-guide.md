Gems in Clash of Clans are the premium currency of the game, something you can use to speed completion of almost anything, complete houses, or buy all sorts of good stuff from the shop to help you run your village. They also help hire more builders for your village, so you can do more work in your village while you go about your day.

They can be bought from the store with real money, but there are other ways to obtain gems without spending a penny. They'll all need some practice, but nothing that goes too far out of the way.
Where to get free gems in Clash of Clans
## Achievements
The first and simplest option is the game awards, providing XP and gems for any achievement. That achievement also has three levels, meaning each can earn you some gems to use.

The reason this is simple is because most rewards come from playing the game. Upgrading to larger and better houses, completing single-player missions, clearing obstacles, disabling other soldiers, stealing some gold and elixir from other players are just some of the ways to do it. On your profile page, you can find what you can do and unlock gems and scroll down. If you're careful with using gems, this alone will earn more than enough to eventually add the fifth villager.
## Removing obstacles
As described above, eliminating obstacles is just one of the accomplishments you can achieve to obtain gems. Yet challenges are still very useful gems themselves.

Obstacles are all the immovable things in your villages that cost elixir and gold to kill. We do have hidden gems, however. You won't get gems from every barrier you eliminate, but it can be as much as every other. They even respawn on your home village and builder base regularly, so there's a constant stream to kill. It'll take a vacant builder to remove them, but they'll all take a few seconds to complete. When you always want diamonds, focus on obstacles!
## Gem mine
Using the boat at the bottom of your home village, this extra camp can be unlocked as you play. This takes you to the PvP-focused Builder Camp. Here you can play matches against others in one verse's fast-paced combat and upgrade units and build as you usually would.

This camp has plenty of trees and stones to remove for gems, but it also has a ruined building to start with called Gem Mine. As you might expect, it works exactly like other resource farms, generating gems over time that you can upgrade to improve the speed it collects. It's an easy way to ensure consistent stream of gems entering your coffers.
## Selling magical items

When you're in a clan that's successful and often participates in clan wars, especially in Clan War Leagues, you may find that any wins your team has attached to your League Medals are a reward for your efforts. These are very useful as ways to buy potions and boons for your home village that can do several things, from increasing the builder's working speed and resource generation to hammers that require instant upgrades to different items in your village, such as building or unit upgrades.

Sometimes, though, gems are more useful. Then, you should sell them. Not all produce a large amount of gems, and often the magic item might be a better long-term choice, but the potential is there if you have any spares. Events and clan games are the best ways to earn these things.
## Events
The game also features competitions, many of which provide incentives to complete those challenges. Often these are followed by other incentives, such as speed or discounts on troops and spell brews, or other bonuses.
The rewards on offer will depend on the event taking place, but there are usually either magic items you can use on your town or sell for gems, or straight gems as a reward. The gem rewards are less regular, but they're a good source of bonuses to produce gems for your money.
## Rewards Google Opinion
This is not a direct way to get free gems and is only open to Android players, but in countries that support the Google Rewards system, you can participate in occasional short surveys that add to your Google Play Store credit with the Google Opinion Rewards app. They don't request any personal details, and you can respond as you wish. The more you engage, the more often you will receive surveys.

This is more than a Clash of Clans. It adds credit to your Google Store, so you can use it on anything in store. Nevertheless, since you can purchase gems from the in-game shop using credit from your Google account, the rewards system will contribute directly to purchasing game gems without actually spending any real money. Building up enough credit will take some time, but it's a quick, free resource to use.
